          All 7 of our microcontrollers are programmed using C. I have
          implemented features all across the car from the steering wheel's
          gauge cluster to the motor controller that drives our motor.

          Throughout this project, I've learned how to effectivly communicate
          both within the software team and to other members working on the
          electrical and mechanial designs.
